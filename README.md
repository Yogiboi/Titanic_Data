# Titanic_Data
# In this folder, I used a dataset from Kaggle about the Titanic. From here, uploaded the dataset to SQL and rename the columns.
# I converted this file to a CSV and uploaded it to Juypter Notebook to look up basic information about the data. The raw data was overall clean.
# I uploaded this to Tableau and created a visualization to see who survived the Titanic along with other information.
