# Titanic_Data
# In this folder, I used a dataset from Kaggle about the Titanic. From here, uploaded the dataset to SQL and rename the columns.
# I converted this file to a CSV and uploaded it to Juypter Notebook to remove the id column and look up basic information about the data.
# I uploaded this to Tableau and created a visualization to see who survived the titanic along with other information.
